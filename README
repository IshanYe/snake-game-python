This file contains the necessary information about the snake game I made in python.

1. This game runs off of 4 different files, these are main, snake, scoreboard and food.
 1a. The main file is responsible for joining the 4 files together to run the game.
 1b. The snake file makes the snake, makes it moves and extends it upon eating food
 1c. The food file generates the food that the snake eats.
 1d. The scoreboard file displays your score at the top, and also displays the "Game Over." message.

2. I made this game as part of the 100 days of Python course on Udemy by Angela Yu.
 2a. Compared to Angela's code, I have reduced a few functions that I deemed unnecessary, and also added more flexibility by allowing the snake to be larger from the start rather than
     hard coding it to be always 3 parts long.
